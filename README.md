# SDA-Project

The project was programmed using Jypter notebook and python 3.8. Make sure the required packages in requirements.txt are downloaded and installed. Without these the project won't work.

You can run: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Open `main.ipynb` in jupyter notebook to view the project. Comments explaning everything are included

It must be noted some cells will require multiple hours to run. Do not execute Fitting distributions and Multi Naive Bayes if you do not want this to happen. All others are save. In Fitting distributions an IndexError is generated. The fix for this has been added. But running the cell again would take to much time before the deadline.

The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022. Unpack Base.csv in the directory as layed out in the code in the notebook.
